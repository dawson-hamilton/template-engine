The purpose of this application is to give a company a way to make a page with everyones information that is easy to see on one page.

​
## Technical Overview
​
1. There are lots of test files that were testing the main employee, manager, engineer, and intern js files. 
2. Those JS files are linked to the main index.js file that controls everything. 
3. the app asks you questions that will then ad information into the html file that will be created at the end. 
4. when you finish the last question the init function creates a html file with all the information that you provided in the 
previous questions.
